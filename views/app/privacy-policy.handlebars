                <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">Who is responsible for data collection in Lumi H5P Desktop Editor?</h2>
                <p>The controller (according to Art. 4 (7) GDPR the legal person who determines the purpose and means of
                    the processing of personal data) is Lumi Education GbR Jan Philip Schellenberg and Sebastian Rettig,

                <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">What data is collected? How is it collected?
                </h2>

                <p>The following data is transmitted to our organization or third parties while you use the app:
                </p>
                <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">On what basis do we collect your data?</h2>

                <p>We collect or transmit your data with your explicit consent (Art. 6 (1) a GDPR) for numbers 1-9. The
                    data transmission in numbers 6-9 is required for the H5P editor and player to work. If you object to
                    it, it is not technically possible to use the app.
                </p>
                <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">How will we use your data?
                </h2>
                <p>Our company collects your data (numbers 1-5) so that we can:
                    decide what parts of the app should be developed further (e.g. choice of languages to localize)
                    to optimize the user interface
                    find and fix bugs
                    contact you with follow-up questions about a bug reported by you
                    Your data is not used for individual decision-making, including profiling.
                    Data that we receive about you is not shared with other companies or organizations, except if we are
                    required to do so by law (e.g. for law enforcement) and for processing purposes (see below).
                    It is beyond our control how data that is transmitted directly to third parties (numbers 6-9) is
                    used by them.

                </p>
                <h2 class="mb-3 mt-5">How do we store your data?</h2>


                <p>Our company uses a processor to securely store the data about your app usage (numbers 1-5) on
                    Google Cloud systems managed by Functional Software, Inc. dba Sentry, 132 Hawthorne Street, San
                    Francisco, CA 94107, USA. This means that this data is transmitted and stored in the USA.
                    Sentry has certified compliance with the EU-U.S. Privacy Shield and is bound to follow all
                    requirements set by the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) by a Data Processing Addendum
                    with Lumi Education GbR. For details how your data is protected by Sentry read their
                    documentation at https://sentry.io/security.
                    Our company will keep your data for two years after it was collected. Once this time period has
                    expired, we will delete your data.
                    It is beyond our control how data that is transmitted directly to third parties (numbers 6-9) is
                    stored by them and for how long. As some of the recipients are resident in the USA, it is likely
                    that your data is transmitted to and stored in the USA.
